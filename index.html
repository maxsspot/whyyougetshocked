        <p>Have you ever went to open a door or have you ever picked up a metal object? Chances are, you probably were 'shocked' once or twice!<br><br>You have probably wondered what that is or why it happens. If you have, look no further, because I have the answer for you!<br><br>Getting shocked involves electrons (e-lek-trons). You, on a normal day, have a lot of electrons. Metal, and things made of metal, on the other hand, do not.<br><br><b>The basic reason you get shocked is because some electrons are jumping from you to the object you are touching.</b><br><br>In conclusion, that is why you may get shocked when touching metal or metal objects.</p>
